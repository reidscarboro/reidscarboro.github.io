			Hi, I'm Reid.
			<br/><br/>
			Web/Games Developer currently living in Florida, moving to Portland, OR in January 2016 where I will be pursuing independent game development.
			<br/><br/>
			I like making all sorts of things, and ultimately just want to make things that bring people happiness, be it through aesthetic, function, or quality.
			<br/><br/>
			I founded <a class="anchorRecolor" href="http://shallotgames.com" target="_blank">Shallot Games</a> with my brother last year, and plan on using it as my channel to release more games. I am currently geared towards mobile because I've always loved handheld gaming, and believe mobile as a platform still has a lot of growth to do.
